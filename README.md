- 🔭 Currently working as fullstack copypaster (React.ts / nodejs / AWS)
- 🤑 Doing things here in my free time, essentially for fun. Using Bitbucket at work ([Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/) soon, hopefully)
- 🌱 Learning about [JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS), a bit of [Clojure](https://www.braveclojure.com), [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/), and [networks](https://i.imgflip.com/12xn39.jpg) and [stuff](https://kubernetes.io/)
- 🖥️ Aside nodejs I mostly feel alive doing [bash](https://www.commandlinefu.com/commands/browse)/[AWK](https://www.junmajinlong.com/shell/awk/index/) scripting, and failing to understand [LLVM literature](https://llvm.org/pubs/). 
- 🙏 Mighty JS: it has the power to [animate Nyan cat cursors](https://www.splitbrain.org/blog/2012-05/20-nyan_cat_on_dokuwiki.org) as much as [totally spy](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/56/Totally_Spies_logo.jpg) people.
