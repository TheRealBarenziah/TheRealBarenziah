- 🔭 Currently working as fullstack copypaster (React.ts / nodejs / AWS)
- 🤑 Doing things here in my free time, essentially for fun. Using Bitbucket at work (Gitlab soon, hopefully)
- 🌱 Learning about [JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS), a bit of [Clojure](https://www.braveclojure.com), [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/), and [networks](https://i.imgflip.com/12xn39.jpg) and [stuff](https://kubernetes.io/)
- 🖥️ Aside using nodejs I mostly feel alive scripting bash/AWK, and failing to understand LLVM literature. 
- 🙏 JS is almighty: it has the power to animate Nyan cat cursors and to spy people with incredible efficiency. [Stallman is right](https://www.gnu.org/help/help-javascript.html) as always
